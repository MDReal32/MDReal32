# Hello, world! 🌍  
I'm **Veys**, a systems-minded developer who builds the invisible layers that make software feel fast, clear, and reliable.

I work at the intersection of **developer tools**, **framework architecture**, and **runtime design** — shaping how code feels to build, not just how it runs.  
My focus is on clarity, craftsmanship, and simplicity inside complex systems.

### 🧪 Philosophy
> “Build tools that make development feel like craftsmanship again.”  

I believe developer experience starts from *architecture clarity*.  
Every tool, from an IDE to a framework, should make engineers feel powerful — not constrained.
